There's been a long standing debate in the past few months on the feasability of developing mobile applications using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS.

Facebook's founder went as far as partly blaming their initial hybrid approach as [the reason they had failed in their mobile strategy](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jjcolao/2012/09/19/facebooks-html5-dilemma-explained/).

> “I think the biggest mistake we made as a company is betting too much on HTML5 as opposed to native,” he admitted, acknowledging his company’s difficulties in piecing together a coherent mobile strategy.

Today Basecamp [announced on their blog](http://signalvnoise.com/posts/3766-hybrid-how-we-took-basecamp-multi-platform-with-a-tiny-team) the release of their new iPad app, which follows a hybrid approach just like their other apps (iPhone, Android and Kindle).

Jason Zimdars, an UI designer, explains on the post in detail how they lay out the different components for the app and how their approach would be if they had to start from scratch today.

But it's these words that makes it clear that they're very optimistic on the whole future of hybrid apps:

> Today’s devices are larger (phones) smaller (tablets), and most importantly more powerful. HTML, CSS and Javascript performance are better than ever, the future looks especially bright for hybrid web apps on the latest versions of iOS and Android. Practical compromises in 2012 might be irrelevant today or in the very near future.

In the post, there's a link to two very interesting articles -- both describing how upcoming versions of both Android and iOS platforms will be more friendly to hybrid applications.

The [9to5mac article](http://9to5mac.com/2014/06/03/ios-8-webkit-changes-finally-allow-all-apps-to-have-the-same-performance-as-safari/) mentions:

> When iOS 7 launched, developers discovered that their apps with built-in web browsers were unable to achieve the same level of JavaScript performance as the stock Safari app. This was because Apple restricted use of its improved Nitro JavaScript engine to its own app, leaving third-parties with a slower version. As of iOS 8, however, it seems that decision has been reversed. All apps will now be able to use the same improved JavaScript engine that powers Safari. That means Google’s Chrome browser on iOS will now be just as quick as Safari, as will the pop-up browsers embedded in apps like Twitter and Facebook.

And the [Techcrunch article](http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/google-blurs-the-line-between-web-and-native-apps-on-android/) explains:

> Today at Google I/O, Chrome Director of Product Management Avni Shah introduced the new version of Chrome coming in the next Android update dubbed Android L. As expected, we got a couple of feature updates. But it isn’t just a better version of Chrome. There is a clear and more profound message coming from Google. The company wants to blend native apps with web tabs. And the end of native apps as we know them could be closer than we might think.

Even though both articles refer to the browsers within the mobile OSs, it does signal an openness on both companies to better support hybrid apps.

My upcoming [Locably](https://locably.com) mobile application is being developed using Cordova and its hybrid model. I want to be able to release to both iOS and Android using the same codebase, and even though the responsiveness is definitely lagging compared to native apps, I have high hopes for the future of the holy grail of "write once deploy to many".
