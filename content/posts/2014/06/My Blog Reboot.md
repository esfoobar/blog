For the third time in its history I've decided to relaunch my blog. This time around, I have a new approach that I think will allow me to work on it on a consistent basis.

After all this time, I still firmly believe it's important that we have independent voices and not let the major blog portals own all the conversation.

#### Blogging is important for me

I've felt the need to blog for a long time. There are many excuses to not blog -- dozens of more urgent things, work, family obligations. And yet, it's an important acitivity that allows me to look back and reflect on things that are happening. It also allows me to connect to people who might learn something from what I write or allow me to learn something from the comments that people leave on the posts or through social media.

At the end of 2009 my life was thrown into unexpected waters and I was forced to look for a new job. I eventually joined a startup that required 100% of my waking hours and was heads down for almost 4 years while I worked there. My blog was so unattended that I decided to pull the plug and just point it to an [about.me](http://about.me/jungleg) page. I also decided to try one of the new publishing platforms, [Medium](https://medium.com/@jungleG), to see if it had the same feeling of blogging.

Every time I saw my homepage, my heart would sink. That page was completely *not* representative of what I wanted to be seen as.

This year I left that startup, and I feel like my life is back in balance. Even though there's the same amount of work, it does allow me to disconnect when I go home.

#### Sharing my knowledge

One of the upsides of going through the startup bootcamp that I experienced for the past 4 years was the amount of new things I learned in both the engineering side and the business side. I intend to share that knowledge on this blog in the coming months. I will blog about server architecture, scalability, responsive design, python and MongoDB (the company I work at today), and random posts about music, TV and movies.

#### New approach to blogging

1. No deadlines: make it feel more like blog all the time, than post every *X* days.
1. No word counts: you're not writing for a magazine or newspaper. Just make sure your idea is expressed well enough and that it's worth writing about.
1. Write what you feel and be yourself: there's no pretending here. You're not trying to convey an image, you're writing about you know and feel.
1. Assume people don't know anything, so that people who are beginning to learn about this field can get a real benefit of reading. If a reader is "above" what I write about, there are other blogs to read.
1. Make it "pseudo" real time: the idea is to have more of a diary of my experiences rather than wait until inspiration hits. That means some posts might change over time.
1. Don't just share links on social media, share links with thoughts around it right here and then post on social media.

I also wanted to pick the right publishing platform for me. I decided I don't want to use Wordpress (too much cruft and security issues), or use Medium or Tumblr (they are content silos that profit from my content), so a long time ago I started looking at static site generators. I will write more about that in an upcoming post.

That's it for now. I feel good I'm back and this time I'm staying.
