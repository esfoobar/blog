Blogging is important. I've felt the need to blog for a long time. There are many excuses to not blog -- thousands of more urgent things, work, family obligations. And yet, it's an important activity for me that is constantly calling me to come back.

A handful of you will remember me from the glory days of blogging. [Louis Gray](http://blog.louisgray.com/) you could say was my inspiration. There was something magical in getting a mention from him, and I was selected as [one of the blogs under the radar](http://blog.louisgray.com/2009/06/five-blogs-under-radar-june-2009.html) on June of 2009. I couldn't feel more excited at the time, it was almost like the Oscars. That was just 5 years ago, but it feels like an eternity.

We also had the most incredible hub called [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com), where, like the famous theme from the TV show "Cheers", everybody knew your name.

Shortly after [Facebook bought FriendFeed](http://techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-acquires-friendfeed/), that community started to dissolve. My life was also thrown into a wind of change, and I was forced to look for a new job. I eventually joined a startup that required 100% of my waking hours, and was about the same story for almost 4 years while I worked there.

My blog was so unattended that I decided to pull the plug and just point it to an [about.me](http://about.me/jungleg) page.
