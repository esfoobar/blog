Jorge Escobar is a technologist and blogger who fell in love with computers from the first time he saw the Texas Instruments TI-994A.

Currently he's [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com)'s Director of Web Engineering, overseeing the web properties and internal tools for the database startup.

Previously he was the first technical hire at [OrderGroove](http://www.ordergroove.com), a SaaS Subscription solution, where he wrote the first version of the platform using JavaScript and Python/Django and eventually used MongoDB to scale the solution to high traffic companies like Grainger, L’Oreal, CVS and Johnson&amp;Johnson while building a team of developers to support further development of the system.

Jorge was also [ExpoTV](http://www.expotv.com)’s Director of Technology, a user-generated video product review site, where along with a team of talented developers, built and scaled a custom media management system that managed hundreds of thousands of user generated videos using PHP and MySQL. Jorge oversaw everything from core platform architecture and development to video storage, scalability, caching and content delivery for major brands including Procter and Gamble, LG Electronics, Sears.com and Shopping.com.

Jorge lives in Brooklyn with Betty, his wife, and dog Mac and cat Leo, loves to code and is trying to get his private pilot license sometime in the near future.
