&lt;p&gt;Blogging is important. I&amp;#8217;ve felt the need to blog for a long time. There are many excuses to not blog &amp;#8212; thousands of more urgent things, work, family obligations. And yet, it&amp;#8217;s an important activity for me that is constantly calling me to come&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A handful of you will remember me from the glory days of blogging. &lt;a href="http://blog.louisgray.com/"&gt;Louis Gray&lt;/a&gt; you could say was my inspiration. There was something magical in getting a mention from him, and I was selected as &lt;a href="http://blog.louisgray.com/2009/06/five-blogs-under-radar-june-2009.html"&gt;one of the blogs under the radar&lt;/a&gt; on June of 2009. I couldn&amp;#8217;t feel more excited at the time, it was almost like the Oscars. That was just 5 years ago, but it feels like an&amp;nbsp;eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had the most incredible hub called &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com"&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt;, where, like the famous theme from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; show &amp;#8220;Cheers&amp;#8221;, everybody knew your&amp;nbsp;name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-acquires-friendfeed/"&gt;Facebook bought FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt;, that community started to dissolve. My life was also thrown into a wind of change, and I was forced to look for a new job. I eventually joined a startup that required 100% of my waking hours, and was about the same story for almost 4 years while I worked&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog was so unattended that I decided to pull the plug and just point it to an &lt;a href="http://about.me/jungleg"&gt;about.me&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="blogging"></category></entry></feed>
