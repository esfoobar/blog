There are many excuses to not blog -- thousands of more urgent things, work, family obligations. And yet, it&#39;s an important activity for me that is constantly calling me to come back. A handful of you will remember me from the glory days of blogging. Louis Gray you could say was my inspiration. There was something magical in getting a mention from him, and I was selected as one of the blogs under the radar on June of 2009. I couldn&#39;t feel more excited at the time, it was almost like the Oscars. That was just 5 years ago, but it feels like an eternity. We also had the most incredible hub called FriendFeed, where, like the famous theme from the TV show &#34;Cheers&#34;, everybody knew your name. Shortly after Facebook bought FriendFeed, that community started to dissolve. My life was also thrown into a wind of change, and I was forced to look for a new job. I eventually joined a startup that required 100% of my waking hours, and was about the same story for almost 4 years while I worked there. My blog was so unattended that I decided to pull the plug and just point it to an about.me page."/>
