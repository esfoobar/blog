&lt;p&gt;For the third time in its history I&amp;#8217;ve decided to relaunch my blog. This time around, I have a new approach that I think will allow me to work on it on a consistent&amp;nbsp;basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all this time, I still firmly believe it&amp;#8217;s important that we have independent voices and not let the major blog portals own all the&amp;nbsp;conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blogging is important for&amp;nbsp;me&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve felt the need to blog for a long time. There are many excuses to not blog &amp;#8212; dozens of more urgent things, work, family obligations. And yet, it&amp;#8217;s an important acitivity that allows me to look back and reflect on things that are happening. It also allows me to connect to people who might learn something from what I write or allow me to learn something from the comments that people leave on the posts or through social&amp;nbsp;media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2009 my life was thrown into unexpected waters and I was forced to look for a new job. I eventually joined a startup that required 100% of my waking hours and was heads down for almost 4 years while I worked there. My blog was so unattended that I decided to pull the plug and just point it to an &lt;a href="http://about.me/jungleg"&gt;about.me&lt;/a&gt; page. I also decided to try one of the new publishing platforms, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@jungleG"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, to see if it had the same feeling of&amp;nbsp;blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I saw my homepage, my heart would sink. That page was completely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; representative of what I wanted to be seen&amp;nbsp;as.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I left that startup, and I feel like my life is back in balance. Even though there&amp;#8217;s the same amount of work, it does allow me to disconnect when I go&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sharing my&amp;nbsp;knowledge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the upsides of going through the startup bootcamp that I experienced for the past 4 years was the amount of new things I learned in both the engineering side and the business side. I intend to share that knowledge on this blog in the coming months. I will blog about server architecture, scalability, responsive design, python and MongoDB (the company I work at today), and random posts about music, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; and&amp;nbsp;movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;New approach to&amp;nbsp;blogging&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No deadlines: make it feel more like blog all the time, than post every &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No word counts: you&amp;#8217;re not writing for a magazine or newspaper. Just make sure your idea is expressed well enough and that it&amp;#8217;s worth writing&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write what you feel and be yourself: there&amp;#8217;s no pretending here. You&amp;#8217;re not trying to convey an image, you&amp;#8217;re writing about you know and&amp;nbsp;feel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume people don&amp;#8217;t know anything, so that people who are beginning to learn about this field can get a real benefit of reading. If a reader is &amp;#8220;above&amp;#8221; what I write about, there are other blogs to&amp;nbsp;read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it &amp;#8220;pseudo&amp;#8221; real time: the idea is to have more of a diary of my experiences rather than wait until inspiration hits. That means some posts might change over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t just share links on social media, share links with thoughts around it right here and then post on social&amp;nbsp;media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to pick the right publishing platform for me. I decided I don&amp;#8217;t want to use Wordpress (too much cruft and security issues), or use Medium or Tumblr (they are content silos that profit from my content), so a long time ago I started looking at static site generators. I will write more about that in an upcoming&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it for now. I feel good I&amp;#8217;m back and this time I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;staying.&lt;/p&gt;
